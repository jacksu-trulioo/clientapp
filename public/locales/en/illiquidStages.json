    "article1": "Illiquid investments tend to involve a longer holding period, with lower price fluctuation (volatility). Each investment, generally experiences a J-Curve trajectory.",
    "article2": "The shape of the J-Curve reflects a full investment cycle. Initially, the investment generates unfavorable returns reflecting initial investment costs. This is usually followed by gradual and steady growth which eventually recoups the initial investment and then begins to generate consistent positive returns.",
    "article3": "The illiquid investments of The Family Office experience a shorter J-Curve because the co-investment approach with global partners is more cost-efficient than a fund-of-funds approach."
